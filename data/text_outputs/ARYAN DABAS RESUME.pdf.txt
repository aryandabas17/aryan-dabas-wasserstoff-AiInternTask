o Worked on machine learning projects involving data preprocessing, model building, and performance
     evaluation. Utilized Python, TensorFlow, and Pandas to develop accurate predictive models, and 
     collaborated with a team to analyse datasets and implement machine learning solutions for real-world
     applications.
PROJECTS
____________________________________________________________________________________
• Hospital Management System 
-
I developed a Hospital Management System (HMS) in Java to streamline hospital operations such as
 patient management, doctor scheduling, billing, and appointment booking. The system uses a 
MySQL database to store patient and staff records securely. It features a user authentication system
 for admins, doctors, and receptionists, allowing them to manage appointments, generate invoices, and
 track medical inventory efficiently. By automating these processes, my HMS improves hospital workflow,
 reduces paperwork, and enhances patient care.Research Paper (Unpublished)
-   Identification of the Best Machine Learning Algorithm for Breast Cancer Detection.

• I have actively engaged in a diverse range of co-curricular pursuits that have enriched my leadership 
and teamwork abilities. As the Event Management Head for almost a year, I orchestrated successful 
gatherings, refining my organizational and communication skills. I also have singing skills and actively
 take part in cultural activities. Additionally, I volunteered with the RIS Department for the G20 
University Connect event, where PM Modi made a physical presence. Furthermore, I attended a 10-day 
adventure camp in Manali under the Government of Himachal Pradesh. These experiences have sculpted 
me into a well-rounded  individual, primed to contribute effectively in any setting.
