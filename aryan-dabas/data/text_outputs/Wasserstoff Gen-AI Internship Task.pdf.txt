AI Software Intern – Internship Task Document 
Internship Role Overview 
As an AI Intern for 6 months (full-time), you will engage in research-driven development 
of Generative AI applications. The internship emphasizes both academic research and 
hands-on implementation, contributing to real product development, exploring research 
papers, and building internal tools. 
Company: Wasserstoff 
Role: AI Intern (Generative AI) – Full-Time, 6 Month Internship 
Focus: Research-based implementation of Generative AI tools and applications (mix of 
research and real product development) 
Required Skills: Python; Transformers and LLM architecture; LangChain framework; 
OpenAI API usage; system design fundamentals; basic database knowledge 
(SQL/NoSQL) 
 
Internship Task: Document Research & Theme Identification Chatbot 
Objective: 
Create an interactive chatbot that can perform research across a large set of documents 
(minimum 75 documents), identify common themes (multiple themes are possible), and 
provide detailed, cited responses to user queries. 
 
Task Breakdown: 
1. Document Upload and Knowledge Base Creation: 
●​ Allow users to upload 75+ documents in various formats including PDF and 
scanned images.​
 
●​ Convert and preprocess scanned documents using OCR (Optical Character 
Recognition).​
 
●​ Extract text content accurately, ensuring high fidelity for research purposes.​
 
●​ Integrate and store uploaded documents in a database for reuse.​
 
2. Document Management & Query Processing: 
●​ Develop an intuitive interface where users can view all uploaded documents.​
 
●​ Allow users to input queries in natural language.​
 
●​ Process these queries individually against each document.​
 
●​ Extract relevant responses with precise citations clearly indicating locations 
(page, paragraph, sentence).​
 
3. Theme Identification & Cross-Document Synthesis: 
●​ Analyze responses from all documents collectively.​
 
●​ Identify coherent common themes across the documents (multiple themes 
possible).​
 
●​ Produce a final synthesized answer clearly indicating all identified themes.​
 
●​ Provide comprehensive citation mapping at a minimum document-level 
granularity to support each synthesized theme.​
 
 
Additional Functionalities (Extra Credit): 
●​ Enhanced granularity of citations (paragraph or sentence level).​
 
●​ Visual representation or mapping interface linking citations to documents.​
 
●​ Advanced filtering options (date, author, document type, relevance scores).​
 
●​ Enable selection/deselection of specific documents for targeted querying.​
 
 
Technical Requirements: 
●​ Modern AI language models (OpenAI GPT, Gemini, Groq) .  
❖​ GPT and Gemini give free credits for testing and project purposes 
❖​ Groq is a free LLM service hosting LLAMA.​
 
●​ Vector databases (Qdrant, ChromaDB, FAISS) for efficient semantic search.​
 
●​ OCR libraries (Tesseract, PaddleOCR) for scanned documents.​
 
●​ Python frameworks such as FastAPI or Flask for backend.​
 
●​ Deployment on free hosting services if necessary (see deployment links below).​
 
 
Deliverables: 
●​ Fully functional web-based chatbot with documented code.​
 
●​ Brief report explaining methodologies and technologies used.​
 
●​ Demonstration video or presentation showcasing functionality and results.​
 
 
Evaluation Criteria: 
●​ Functionality: Objectives achievement of document research, theme 
identification, citation.​
 
●​ Code Quality & Structure: Modular design, readability, proper naming, 
comments, version control usage.​
 
●​ Error Handling: Robust handling of exceptions or failures.​
 
●​ Documentation Clarity: Comprehensive README and demonstration video.​
 
●​ System Design Insight: Scalability and deployment considerations.​
 
●​ User Interface: Simplicity and clarity.​
 
 
Presentation of Results: 
●​ Individual document responses in tabular format. Example:​
 
Document 
ID 
Extracted Answer 
Citation 
DOC001 
The order states that the fine was imposed under section 
15 of the SEBI Act. 
Page 4, 
Para 2 
DOC002 
Tribunal observed delay in disclosure violated Clause 49 
of LODR.

Para 1 
●​ ​
Final synthesized response in chat format with clear citations marked by 
document IDs. Example:​
 
Theme 1 – Regulatory Non-Compliance:​
 Documents (DOC001, DOC002) highlight regulatory non-compliance with 
SEBI Act and LODR. 
Theme 2 – Penalty Justification:​
 DOC001 explicitly justifies penalties under statutory frameworks.
